In 2012, sales were lower, but profit margins were higher relative to sales, indicating better cost efficiency.
In the South region, sales contribution was highest in 2011compared to following years, but gradually declined in the following years.
The Technology and Office Supplies categories contributed the most to total sales.
Some regions with high sales volumes still show low profitability, highlighting operational inefficiencies.
